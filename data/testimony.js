        text: "As a start-up, we always faced the challenge of generating content. Either we would create content ourselves (necessary but time-consuming) or work with freelancers (below quality). We also tried getting a person on our payroll, but over some time, we would get the same quality of content and we were unable to produce anything new. Writing Impact solved our problem by giving us a panel of content experts. They not only generated quality content but also provided topics in advance. The content team has closely worked with us on the Good Lyfe Project. They are an extension of our team and have produced high quality content.If you are riding on the same ship as we were,  you should definitely consider Writing Impact.",
